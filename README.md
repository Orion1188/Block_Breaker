# Block Breaker

## About the project

This is my first attempt at making a game in Python using pygame library. My inspiration to this project was an old game called DX-Ball created by Michael P. Welch and Seumas McNally in 1996.
The project was made as an assignment for a programming course at my university two years ago.

## How to run the game

Run the python file "main.py".
